Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, and Machine Learning Modeling on the iconic Titanic dataset. The dataset captures the fate of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.


---

📌 Objectives

Understand the structure and characteristics of the Titanic dataset.

Use 11+ visualization methods to explore relationships between features and survival.

Perform data cleaning and feature engineering.

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict survival.



---

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA includes a variety of plots and visualizations to discover insights into the dataset. The following plot types were used:

Bar Plot

Swarm Plot

Line Plot

Scatter Plot

Heatmap

Violin Plot

Box Plot

Histogram

Count Plot

Facet Grid Plot

Pair Plot


🔍 Key Explorations:

Survival rate by gender and class

Age and fare distributions

Correlation heatmap of numeric features

Distribution of passengers across different ports (Embarked)



---

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps:

Handling Missing Values: Imputation of missing Age, Embarked, and Cabin data.

Feature Engineering:

Extracted titles (Mr., Miss, etc.) from names

Created FamilySize feature from SibSp + Parch

Binning of continuous variables like Age and Fare


Encoding: Categorical features were encoded using LabelEncoding and/or One-Hot Encoding.

Scaling: Numerical features were scaled for model compatibility.



---

🤖 Machine Learning Models

The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the following models were trained and evaluated:

Model	Description

Logistic Regression	Linear classification model
Decision Tree	Tree-based classification algorithm
Random Forest	Ensemble of decision trees
Gradient Boosting	Boosted ensemble tree model


✅ Evaluation

Models were evaluated using accuracy score.

Confusion matrices and classification reports may have been used to measure performance.



---

📌 Results

Best performing models: Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) showed strong accuracy.

Top predictors of survival: Gender, Passenger Class, Age, and Fare emerged as significant features.
